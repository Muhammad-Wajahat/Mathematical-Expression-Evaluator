# C++ Command Line Mathematical Expression Solver:

Welcome to the C++ Command Line Mathematical Expression Solver project! This endeavor delves into the realm of solving mathematical expressions through the command line interface. The project is primarily centered around implementing the process of evaluating mathematical expressions while considering the hierarchy of operators and proper parenthesis placement. Here's a breakdown of the key features and concepts:

1) **Expression Transformation**: At the heart of this project lies the process of transforming mathematical expressions from their traditional infix notation (e.g., 2 + 3) into the highly efficient postfix notation (e.g., 2 3 +). This transformation paves the way for subsequent evaluation.

2) **Operator Precedence**: To ensure accurate results, the project takes into account the precedence of operators. This means that multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction are treated in the correct order, mirroring mathematical conventions.

3) **Utilizing the Stack Data Structure**: The project employs the **Stack** data structure extensively. The stack aids in both the conversion of expressions and the evaluation process. By strategically utilizing the stack, the project maintains a structured approach to processing expressions.

4) **Parenthesis Validation**: Correct parenthesis placement is crucial for valid mathematical expressions. The project employs the stack to confirm whether the opening and closing parentheses are balanced and properly arranged, which helps prevent evaluation errors.

5) **Algorithmic Insights**: This project provides a practical demonstration of algorithms and data structures working in tandem. It showcases how these components can be combined to achieve complex tasks, shedding light on their importance in computer science.

In essence, this project serves as an educational tool to understand how algorithms, data structures, and systematic approaches come together to solve real-world challenges. By exploring the code and concepts behind the C++ Command Line Mathematical Expression Solver, you can gain valuable insights into expression evaluation, algorithm design, and the power of the stack data structure.
